## DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK

As part of my **Full Stack Web Development Internship** at **Codtech IT Solutions**, I successfully completed **Task-2: Real-Time Chat Application**.  
The objective of this task was to design and develop a real-time web-based chat system that enables instant communication between multiple users using modern web technologies.

This project is built using **React.js** on the frontend and **Node.js with Express.js** on the backend. Real-time communication is implemented using **Socket.IO**, which allows bi-directional communication between the client and server without page refresh.

The application provides a login screen where users can enter a username and join the chat. Once connected, users can send and receive messages instantly. The chat interface is inspired by **WhatsApp-style UI**, featuring sender and receiver message bubbles, usernames, timestamps, and a clean professional layout. Messages sent by the current user appear on the right side, while received messages appear on the left side.

Additional features such as **online user status**, **typing indicator**, and **real-time user list** have been implemented to enhance the chat experience. The UI is fully **responsive**, supports **dark mode**, and works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

The project follows a clean folder structure with separate **client** and **server** directories, ensuring scalability and maintainability. Git and GitHub were used for version control, and the project was successfully pushed to a public GitHub repository as part of the internship submission.

This task helped me gain strong hands-on experience in real-time application development, WebSocket communication, frontend-backend integration, and professional UI design.
